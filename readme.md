## 🚨 The Problem
London life is full of traps: awkward Hinge dates, never-ending lectures, or getting cornered by a flat-earther in the pub. British politeness makes it impossible to just say "I'm leaving."

## 💡 The Solution
**Exit Strategy** is a "Panic Button" app that generates a high-stakes, undeniable emergency on demand.

1.  **Context Aware:** You type "Boring date".
2.  **Stealth Mode:** You hit the Red Button. The screen goes black.
3.  **The Call:** 3 seconds later, your phone rings ("MUM ❤️") with **Real Haptics**.
4.  **The Escape:** You pick up. The AI generates a chaotic, **London-specific emergency script** and screams it through the earpiece.
